= Antwort Documentation

Antwort is the open-source OpenResponses API implementation for production.
It runs AI agents server-side on Kubernetes with sandboxed code execution, multi-tenant isolation, and full API compatibility with any OpenAI SDK.

== Getting Started

Start with the xref:getting-started.adoc[Quickstart Guide] to deploy Antwort on your Kubernetes cluster.

== Key Features

* **OpenResponses API**: Full compliance with the OpenResponses specification. Any OpenAI SDK works.
* **Agentic Loop**: Multi-turn reasoning with concurrent tool execution.
* **Multi-Provider**: vLLM, LiteLLM, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
* **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol integration for external tool servers.
* **Multi-Tenant Auth**: JWT/OIDC and API key authentication with tenant isolation.
