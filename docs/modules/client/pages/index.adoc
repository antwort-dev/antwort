= Client SDKs
:description: Using Antwort from application code with OpenAI-compatible SDKs.

Antwort implements the https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses[OpenAI Responses API].
Any application built with an official OpenAI SDK can point at an Antwort instance and work without modification.
You do not need a special client library.

== Supported SDKs

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Language | Package | Install

| Python
| https://github.com/openai/openai-python[openai]
| `pip install openai`

| TypeScript / Node
| https://github.com/openai/openai-node[openai]
| `npm install openai`

| Go
| https://github.com/openai/openai-go[openai-go]
| `go get github.com/openai/openai-go`

| Java
| https://github.com/openai/openai-java[openai-java]
| Maven / Gradle

| .NET
| https://github.com/openai/openai-dotnet[openai-dotnet]
| `dotnet add package OpenAI`
|===

== Connecting to Antwort

Every OpenAI SDK accepts a `base_url` (or equivalent) parameter.
Point it at your Antwort instance and all Responses API calls go through Antwort instead of OpenAI.

[source,python]
----
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://antwort.example.com/v1",  # <1>
    api_key="your-api-key",                      # <2>
)
----
<1> Replace with your Antwort endpoint.
The `/v1` path prefix is required.
<2> The API key depends on your Antwort auth configuration.
Use any non-empty string if auth is set to `none`.
