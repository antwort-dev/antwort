Antwort is designed for Kubernetes-native deployment using Kustomize.
The project ships a base layer of manifests and environment-specific overlays for development, production, and OpenShift.
This page covers manifest structure, security hardening, health probes, scaling, and container image configuration.

== Kustomize Structure

The deployment manifests follow the standard Kustomize base-plus-overlay pattern.

[source,text]
----
deploy/kubernetes/
  base/
    kustomization.yaml
    serviceaccount.yaml
    configmap.yaml
    deployment.yaml
    service.yaml
  overlays/
    dev/
      kustomization.yaml
    production/
      kustomization.yaml
      hpa.yaml
      pdb.yaml
    openshift/
      kustomization.yaml
      route.yaml
      deployment-patch.yaml
      postgres/
----

The base layer provides the core resources that every environment needs.
Overlays customize the base for specific deployment targets without duplicating manifests.

=== Deploying with Kustomize

To deploy the base configuration:

[source,bash]
----
kustomize build deploy/kubernetes/base | kubectl apply -f -
----

To deploy with an overlay:

[source,bash]
----
kustomize build deploy/kubernetes/overlays/production | kubectl apply -f -
----

== Base Manifests

=== Deployment

The base Deployment runs a single replica of the antwort container.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: antwort
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: antwort
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: antwort
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
      containers:
        - name: antwort
          image: ghcr.io/rhuss/antwort:latest
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: antwort-config
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
            limits:
              memory: 512Mi
----

Configuration is injected through the `antwort-config` ConfigMap.
All `ANTWORT_*` environment variables are mapped to the corresponding YAML config fields.

=== Service

The base Service exposes the gateway on port 8080 within the cluster.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: antwort
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      targetPort: http
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: antwort
----

=== ConfigMap

The base ConfigMap sets sensible defaults for development.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: antwort-config
data:
  ANTWORT_PORT: "8080"
  ANTWORT_PROVIDER: "vllm"
  ANTWORT_BACKEND_URL: "http://vllm:8000"
  ANTWORT_STORAGE: "memory"
  ANTWORT_STORAGE_SIZE: "10000"
  ANTWORT_AUTH_TYPE: "none"
----

You must update `ANTWORT_BACKEND_URL` to point to your actual LLM backend.
Set `ANTWORT_MODEL` if your backend requires a specific model name.

== Container Security

The base Deployment enforces a locked-down security posture following Kubernetes Pod security best practices.

**Pod-level security context:**

* `runAsNonRoot: true` prevents the container from running as UID 0.
* `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` applies the default syscall filter.

**Container-level security context:**

* `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` blocks `setuid` binaries and privilege escalation.
* `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` makes the root filesystem immutable.
* `capabilities.drop: [ALL]` removes all Linux capabilities.

These settings satisfy the Kubernetes `restricted` Pod Security Standard and work on OpenShift without requiring a custom SecurityContextConstraints resource.
The default `restricted-v2` SCC on OpenShift 4.x is compatible with this configuration.

== Health Probes

The gateway exposes a single health endpoint at `/healthz` that returns HTTP 200 with the body `ok`.
This endpoint is excluded from authentication middleware.

The base Deployment configures three probe types:

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Probe | Configuration | Purpose

| **Startup**
| `GET /healthz`, failureThreshold: 30, period: 2s
| Allows up to 60 seconds for initial startup. The other probes do not run until the startup probe succeeds.

| **Liveness**
| `GET /healthz`, initialDelay: 5s, period: 10s, timeout: 3s
| Restarts the container if the process becomes unresponsive.

| **Readiness**
| `GET /healthz`, initialDelay: 3s, period: 5s, timeout: 3s
| Removes the Pod from the Service endpoint pool if it cannot serve traffic.
|===

The startup probe is configured with a generous failure threshold because the gateway connects to backend services (LLM providers, MCP servers, PostgreSQL) during initialization.

== Image Registry

The default image is `ghcr.io/rhuss/antwort:latest`, hosted on GitHub Container Registry.

For environments with pull rate limits (such as OpenShift clusters pulling from Docker Hub), the OpenShift overlay remaps to `quay.io/rhuss/antwort`:

[source,yaml]
----
images:
  - name: ghcr.io/rhuss/antwort
    newName: quay.io/rhuss/antwort
----

To pin a specific version, use a Kustomize image override:

[source,yaml]
----
images:
  - name: ghcr.io/rhuss/antwort
    newTag: v0.5.0
----

== Resource Recommendations

The following table summarizes resource settings across deployment targets.

[cols="2,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Target | CPU Request | Memory Request | Memory Limit | Replicas

| Development
| 100m
| 128Mi
| 512Mi
| 1

| Production
| 200m
| 256Mi
| 1Gi
| 2+
|===

Antwort is a stateless proxy that translates between the Responses API and backend Chat Completions API.
Memory usage scales primarily with the number of concurrent streaming connections and the size of in-memory response storage.
For deployments with PostgreSQL storage, the in-memory footprint is lower.

== Production Overlay

The production overlay increases resources, sets two replicas, and adds autoscaling with disruption budgets.

=== HorizontalPodAutoscaler

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: antwort
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: antwort
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
----

The autoscaler targets 70% CPU utilization across replicas.
Because antwort is stateless, horizontal scaling works without session affinity.
If you use in-memory storage, each replica maintains an independent store.
For shared state across replicas, configure PostgreSQL storage.

=== PodDisruptionBudget

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: antwort
spec:
  minAvailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: antwort
----

The PodDisruptionBudget ensures that at least one replica remains available during voluntary disruptions such as node drains and cluster upgrades.

== OpenShift Overlay

The OpenShift overlay extends the base with platform-specific resources.

=== Route

The overlay creates a Route with edge TLS termination.
The OpenShift router handles TLS, and traffic between the router and the antwort Service is unencrypted within the cluster network.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: antwort
spec:
  tls:
    termination: edge
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: antwort
  port:
    targetPort: http
----

=== PostgreSQL

The OpenShift overlay includes a PostgreSQL StatefulSet with persistent storage.
It patches the ConfigMap to switch storage to `postgres` and mounts the DSN as a file from a Secret.

[source,yaml]
----
# ConfigMap patch
data:
  ANTWORT_STORAGE: "postgres"
  ANTWORT_STORAGE_DSN_FILE: "/run/secrets/postgres/dsn"
  ANTWORT_STORAGE_MIGRATE: "true"
----

The Deployment patch mounts the Secret as a volume:

[source,yaml]
----
volumes:
  - name: postgres-credentials
    secret:
      secretName: postgres-credentials
      items:
        - key: dsn
          path: dsn
----

This pattern keeps credentials out of environment variables and ConfigMaps, using the `_file` suffix convention described in the xref:reference:configuration.adoc[Configuration Guide].

=== SecurityContextConstraints

The antwort container runs with the default `restricted-v2` SCC on OpenShift 4.x.
No custom SCC is required because the container security context (non-root, read-only filesystem, all capabilities dropped) satisfies the restricted policy.
